# Early-Stage-Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Project created as a part of curriculum for Intro to Data Science. 

● Built a machine learning prediction model in Python using libraries such as Sci-kit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pickle, Tkinter, and PDPbox
● Trained and tested the dataset using machine learning models such as Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision tree, SVM, and KNN
● Analyzed correlations between different attributes using Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient
